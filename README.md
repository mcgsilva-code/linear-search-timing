# LINEAR SEARCH TIMING ⏱️

**Practical Analysis of Linear Search Efficiency**

This project measures the execution time of the Linear Search algorithm on lists of varying sizes and generates a graph to visually show its O(n) behavior.

## Features
- Measures time taken to find an element in lists of different sizes
- Plots a graph to visualize performance
- Helps understand why Linear Search is O(n)

## Usage
1. Open the `linear_search_timing.py` file in Python
2. Run the script
3. View the graph showing execution time vs list size

## Tech
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
